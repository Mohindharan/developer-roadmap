Today, organizations rely on PKI to manage security through encryption. Specifically, the most common form of encryption used today involves a public key, which anyone can use to encrypt a message, and a private key (also known as a secret key), which only one person should be able to use to decrypt those messages. These keys can be used by people, devices, and applications. 

PKI is so important in todayâ€™s digital age because there are now millions of applications and connected devices that require certification. Properly authenticating and maintaining certificates for these technologies is essential to keeping our highly connected world secure.
